Http API
========
Liveall.eu offers an **HTTP API** for SMS send-out and various operations like fetching the account balance etc.
This API is available to any desktop application, web/mobile app, web-APIs, script being able to make calls to a web service.

Currently there are 2 types of API. The simple (**x-www-form-urlencoded**) and the more advanced (**application/json**). Both APIs use the **POST** method.
There is also an old version of the API (obsolete), which is only used by legacy customer installations and it shouldn't be used by newcomers.
