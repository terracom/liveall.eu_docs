Advanced API (application/json API)
===================================

This type of API offers more flexibilty when using it, since you can easily and straight-forward to send messages to many recipients with a different text for each one.
The ``Content-Type`` on the request headers is set to ``application/json`` and all the data structure is a text, representing a **JSON object**.
